# API-Server
An IaC implementation of expressjs api on a server.

create a new repo
build an expressjs API
provision.sh that builds
deploy.sh that runs the API in the VM (using a service file). Use Ubuntu again for the VM. Everyone should put the repo in their own Github accounts and add me stephenlauck and I can do reviews on any of your code.
When we get that API code done, we'll work on a CI/CD pipeline to deliver it (not in the local vm)

Also maybe make a local.sh that sets up your local dev environment.
